# If Clauses (Conditionals)

"If" clauses, or conditional sentences, express conditions and the possible outcomes or implications of those conditions. They are typically divided into several types based on the likelihood or time frame of the condition and outcome.

## Types of Conditionals

### Zero Conditional (General Truths)
- **Form:** If + present simple, present simple
- **Use:** To talk about general truths or laws of nature.

**Example:**
- "If you heat ice, it melts."
- "If plants don't get water, they die."

### First Conditional (Future Possibility)
- **Form:** If + present simple, will + infinitive
- **Use:** To talk about a possible future event and its consequence.

**Example:**
- "If it rains, we will cancel the trip."
- "If you hurry, you will catch the bus."

### Second Conditional (Unlikely Future or Hypothetical)
- **Form:** If + past simple, would + infinitive
- **Use:** To talk about unlikely or hypothetical situations.

**Example:**
- "If I won the lottery, I would travel the world."
- "If he studied more, he would pass the exam."

### Third Conditional (Past Hypothetical)
- **Form:** If + past perfect, would have + past participle
- **Use:** To talk about a condition in the past that did not happen and its possible outcome.

**Example:**
- "If I had known about the party, I would have attended."
- "If they had left earlier, they would have avoided the traffic."

## Mixed Conditional
Mixed conditionals combine time frames, usually relating a past condition to a present or ongoing consequence.

- **Form:** Varies, typically if + past perfect, would + infinitive
- **Use:** To talk about hypothetical situations where the cause is in the past but the effect is in the present.

**Example:**
- "If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now."
