# Reported Speech

Reported speech is used to relay what someone said without quoting them directly. It often involves backshifting tenses and adjusting pronouns and time expressions.

## Direct Speech to Reported Speech Conversion
When converting direct speech into reported speech, the tense of the original statement is usually shifted back one tense. For example, present simple goes to past simple, present continuous goes to past continuous, etc. Here are the common changes:

- Present Simple → Past Simple
- Present Continuous → Past Continuous
- Present Perfect → Past Perfect
- Will → Would
- Can → Could

**Example:**
- Direct: He said, "I am eating."
- Reported: He said he was eating.

## Format for Reported Statements, Questions, and Commands
